|There are several medical alert systems for senior citizens on the market, however, these require up-front costs as well as monthly subscriptions. The fundamental idea behind our project is to provide an affordable means of protecting the health, welfare, and safety of elderly people through an active ad-hoc wireless network (estimated to have a working range of 300 feet) connected to personal push-button sensors, developed specifically for residents of the De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile Home Park.
